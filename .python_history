Learning is about pursuing career development, working on new job skills, and accomplishing strategic goals for ourselves and the organization, right? <i>Yes</i> to all of the above. But as Pamay points out, it’s a lot of other things too. 
When learning is part of the culture of the business, it suddenly becomes clear that everything—from how you responded to that snipe from your teenager at the breakfast table to the surprising realization you came to after last week’s all-hands town hall—is a learning experience. Here are a few places where we likely do some of our best learning “in the flow of life,” often without realizing it.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Podcasts, articles, and thought leadership:</strong> We all know that the media we engage with shapes our thinking, but we may not always realize how much we’re learning. Take a beat next time you pick up a book or download a podcast to notice what new information you’re filing away. Everything we consume (for work or for pleasure) contributes to our base of general knowledge. </li>
	<li>
	<strong>Conversations, debates, and dialogues:</strong> Any situation that pushes us to shift perspectives advances our understanding. A particularly compelling conversation about a dense topic can accomplish this goal. So can a disagreement or debate. Though it’s often uncomfortable, we do some of our best learning when someone challenges our beliefs or thinking. </li>
	<li>
	<strong>Correspondence, collaboration, and meetings:</strong> How many times have you been baffled by a colleague’s initial idea only to have it become instantly clear when you take five minutes to discuss it? Whether it came in the form of an email that clearly outlined a new concept or a meeting that gave everyone an opportunity to understand a proposed new venture, collaboration often opens the door to improved understanding of tricky topics. </li>
	<li>
	<strong>Mistakes, feedback, and critiques:</strong> We often learn more from the things we do wrong than the things we do right. When we are able to embrace feedback and look our errors squarely in the eye, we usually discover that they yield valuable insights that we might otherwise have missed out on. </li>
	<li>
	<strong>Curiosity and chance encounters:</strong> Never underestimate the power of serendipity in the learning process. So much of what we learn is the result of an impulsive detour, a quick Google search turned research deep-dive, or an unexpected interaction or experience. All of that learning, however unplanned, adds value to our lives, our experiences, and our work.</li>
